# burned_area
Introduction

This project shows the NDVI process applied for burnt areas. Burnt areas are clearly visible in 
the ndvi image created with the help of various libraries. Burnt areas in the Izmir, KarabaÄŸlar
region dated 2019 were shown with false color and NDVI image.

For forest fire study, remote sensing from space is particularly appropriate. The wide area
coverage and constant repetition provided by satellite sensors, together with their information on
non-visible spectral areas, make them a very useful instrument for wildland fire prevention,
detection and mapping.

Data
Landsat 8 images dated 23/08/2019 were used within the scope of the project. Four image bands(red,
green, blue, near-infrared) were used in order to show true color, false color and NDVI images.
Images were resampled and subsetted. Code explanations were made in more detail in the script file.
